# Chest X-Ray Disease Classification
This research group project was completed in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the CMPE 255 Data Mining course at the San Jose State University and under the careful supervision of Dr.	Gheorghi Guzun.<br />
  
Chest X-Rays are extensively used in field of medical to examine chest,heart,lungs blood veseels and other surrounding structure in human body for possible medical conditions and identifications of diseased ailments such as Pneumonia,Cardiomegaly,Effusion,Pleural_Thickening and other chest issues.Recently some of COVID-19 cases has been detected using Chest X-Rays.All classification of diseases is done manually.Presently,there is no automated framework exist to accurately classification diseases using Chest X-Ray.Standford ML Group has developed [CheXNet](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/projects/chexnet/) to detect pneumonia from chest X-rays at a level exceeding practicing radiologists.This has caused huge interest in developing automated framework to correctly predict diseases.<br/>

Our project aims to apply image classfication techniques using Deep Learning to classify X-Rays into 14 categories 
* Atelectasis
* Cardiomegaly
* Consolidation 
* Edema 
* Effusion  
* Emphysema 
* Fibrosis 
* Infiltration
* Mass 
* Nodule
* Pleural_Thickening
* Pneumonia
* Pneumothorax

## Technologies and Tools
* Tensorflow 
* Keras
* OpenCV-Python (Python API for Python)

## Tensorflow
Tensorflow is an open source machine learning developed by Google as part of its Google Brain Project.

## Keras
Keras is an open source neural network libray written in Python.It is built on top on Tensorflow and can be easily integrated with other neural network libraries

## OpenCV-Python
OpenCV is computer vision library release by Intel in 1999 and first release in 2000.OpenCV-Python is the Python API of OpenCV. It combines the best qualities of OpenCV C++ API and Python language.

## Dataset
National Institutes of Health Chest X-Ray Dataset. It consists of 112,120 X-ray images with disease labels from 30,805 unique patients
